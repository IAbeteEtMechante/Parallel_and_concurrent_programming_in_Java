# Parallel and Concurrent programming in Java

This repo is grouping the very basics on how to do parallel and concurrent programming in Java

A good place to start is to read chapter 11 in the book:"Java A beginner's Guide 7th edition"

Then you can watch this [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBB24CFB073F1048E) of Youtube videos.

This repo is bases on those videos:

* [CountDownLatch](https://github.com/IAbeteEtMechante/Parallel_and_concurrent_programming_in_Java/tree/master/src/main/java/countdownlatch)
